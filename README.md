# Traffic Violation Detection using YOLO

This project detects vehicles violating traffic rules using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. It can identify vehicles from images/videos, highlight violations, and extract license plates for further action. The project includes both training and inference pipelines, along with a simple application interface for demonstrations.

## ðŸš¦ Features
- Detect vehicles in real-time or from files
- Identify traffic violations (e.g., signal jumping, lane crossing)
- Extract vehicle number plates
- Supports multiple YOLO models (`yolov8n`, `yolov8s`, `yolo11n`)
- Easy-to-use app interface

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `train.py` â†’ Train YOLO model on custom dataset
- `script.py` â†’ Run detection & save results
- `app.py` â†’ Interactive app (Streamlit)
- `data/` â†’ Dataset folder
- `runs/detect/` â†’ Output results

## ðŸ›  Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anubhav-Anand-26/Minor-Project-2.git
